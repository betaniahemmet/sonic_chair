## Description

# A sonic chair to experience the lower end of music as a tactile feeling.

This is just stl-files to 3d-print to fit into an IKEA po√§ng chair.
You will also need:

* An IKEA poang chair
* Bass shakers with the same size/mounting pattern as [Dayton Audio - TT25](https://www.daytonaudio.com/product/1036/tt25-16-puck-tactile-transducer-mini-bass-shaker)
* An amplifier with Bluetooth capabilities, I included brackets to mount a [Nikabe D3](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/ljud-bild/pa-ljud-underhallning/forstarkare/nikabe-d3-forstarkare-2.1-med-bluetooth-2x50-w-p23907?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwg8qzBhAoEiwAWagLrFAzcnaOZNPncPVFP54fa3V1-bQ2EQCMIABnlqTX8VhnOIxk68ZrHhoCjzQQAvD_BwE)to the back of the poang chair.
* Some speaker cable and electrical tape or heat shrink tubing and maybe staples.

I printed the bracket for the amp on it's side, to minimize the need for supports.
Just pre-drill the holes in the chair and screw everything in place with nuts and bolts.
